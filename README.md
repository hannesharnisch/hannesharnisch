## Hey, I'm Hannes 👋

I'm currently studying at the University of Potsdam 🧑‍🎓 in Germany 🇩🇪
I love [Swift](https://swift.org) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org).
Also doing smaller projects with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com), [Python](https://www.python.org), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and others.

Beside coding 👨‍💻, I like sports - going to the gym 🏋🏻, Calisthenics and Sailing ⛵ 

⚡ Fun fact: 2-time German champion in sailing
